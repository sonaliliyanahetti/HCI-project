We recreated the Moratuwa E-learning platform using Figma with a focus on making it more user-friendly.We conducted user interviews with real-world users to better understand the challenges they face when using the current website. These insights helped us identify usability issues and informed our redesign decisions to create a more user-friendly platform.. Figma was used to design wireframes and mockups for dashboards, ensuring visual clarity, proper layout, and realistic interaction. To enhance the project, we incorporated several advanced features of Figma: 

Advanced Features in Our Design

Frames & Layout Grids
We used frames with proper dimensions (1440 × 1445) along with grid and layout options. This ensures consistency, responsiveness, and proper alignment across all screens.

Components & Reusable Elements
Key interface elements such as the navigation bar, footer, dashboard cards, and search bar were created as reusable components. This not only maintains design consistency but also accelerates the design process during iterations.

Prototype Linking (Navigation Flow)
Prototype mode was enabled, allowing us to link multiple screens such as the Dashboard, Forum, Calendar Page, and Course Recommendation Page. This created an interactive navigation flow for testing the user journey.

Variants & Interactive Elements
Cards like “Course Recommended for You” and “My Course Page” were designed using component variants. This allows hover states, click states, and alternative content styles, making the prototype feel more dynamic and interactive.

Auto Layout
Auto Layout was applied to panels such as course cards, forum tables, and content blocks. This feature ensures that spacing and alignment automatically adjust when elements are resized or content changes, keeping the layout neat and adaptive.

Smart Animate & Page Transitions (Prototype Mode)
We applied Smart Animate and smooth page transitions between key pages (Dashboard → Course → Forum → Calendar). This provides a seamless experience when simulating interactions.

Information Architecture & User Testing Simulation
The design includes multiple end-to-end flows such as Login → Dashboard → Course Content → Forum → Calendar. This allows us to simulate real user experiences and test the effectiveness of the platform’s information architecture.

Plugins / Widgets
We enhanced realism by using Figma plugins and widgets for elements like calendars, forms, and forum tables. These components added authenticity to the design and made the prototype closer to an actual working system.
